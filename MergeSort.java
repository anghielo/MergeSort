/*
   Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort on your computer to sort a list of n elements. Carry out a
   complete test of your algorithms with n = 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000,...(up to the largest
   size of n that your computer can handle â€“ You should stop the program for any method if it takes
   more than 10 minutes to run). Draw a graph to compare the growth rates of these two algorithms.
